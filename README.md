## How to Clone and Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   - Use the `cd` command to change into the project folder:
     ```bash
     cd your-repo-name
     ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   - Install the required npm packages by running:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - This installs all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

4. **Run the project**:
   - Start the development server with:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the website.

The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
